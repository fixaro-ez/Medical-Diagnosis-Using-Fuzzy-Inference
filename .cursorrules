AI System Prompt Instructions: "You are helping build a Medical Diagnosis System. We are using a modular architecture.

    No UI Code: Do not write any Streamlit or GUI code in engine.py. Only logic.

    Strict Structure: You must follow the get_inputs() and run_inference(user_data) pattern.

    Input Scaling: All fuzzy membership functions must be mapped to the min/max values defined in get_inputs.

    Return Format: Always return a dictionary with risk_percentage, risk_level, and recommendation keys."

    Module Path: You are working inside modules/[disease_name]/engine.py.

    Data Storage: If you need to load a CSV or JSON file, look in the data/ folder relative to your current file (os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'data', 'filename.csv')). Never use absolute paths.


UI Architecture Rules (The Contract):

    Dynamic Rendering: The module must provide all metadata required to build the UI. Do not assume the UI knows your symptoms.

    Input Schema: Each dictionary in get_inputs() must strictly follow this format to ensure the main.py renderer doesn't crash:

        type: Must be exactly "slider" or "selectbox".

        name: Internal variable name (lowercase, no spaces).

        label: User-facing label (Sentence case).

        unit: (String) The unit of measurement (e.g., "°C", "bpm", "mg/dL").

        help: (String) A short tooltip explaining the symptom to the user.

    Visual Feedback Logic:

        Risk Levels: Use a standard 3-tier system: Low, Medium, High.

        Colors: The AI should not define colors in the engine, but the risk_level string must match these exactly so the UI can apply CSS: "Low", "Medium", "High".

    Output Requirements:

        The run_inference result must include a reasoning key: A brief explanation of why the fuzzy logic reached that conclusion (e.g., "High fever combined with low SpO2 triggered the 'Critical' rule")
